 of Acharnai** was secretary. 

 Theophilos of Halimous**+3+ was chairman.

 Androtion son of Andron of Gargettos**+4+ proposed:

 concerning what Spartokos** and Pairisades** have written in their letter

 &10& and what the envoys who have come from them

 report, to reply to them that the Athenian

 People praises Spartokos** and Pairisades**

 because they are good men and undertake 

 for the Athenian People to look after

 &15& the export of grain, as their

 father did, and to perform enthusiastically whatever

 service the People may require; and the envoys

 shall report to them that if they do these things

 there is nothing that they will fail to obtain from

 &20& the Athenian People; and since they make the same grants

 to the Athenians as Satyros** and Leukon** made,+5+

 the grants which the People made

 to Satyros** and Leukon**+6+ shall apply to Spartokos** and Pairisades**;

 and to crown each of them with a gold crown 

 &25& at every Great Panathenaia, of a thousand drachmas;

 and the Games-masters {athlothetas} shall have the crowns

 made in the year before the Great

 Panathenaia, in accordance with the decree of the People

 voted previously for Leukon**; and to announce

 &30& that the Athenian People crowns

 Spartokos** and Pairisades**, the children of

 Leukon**, for their excellence and good will towards the

 Athenian People; and since they are dedicating

 the crowns to Athena Polias,

 &35& the Games-masters {athlothetas} shall dedicate

 the crowns in the temple, having inscribed on them: “Spartokos**

 and Pairisades**, children of Leukon**, dedicated

 to Athena having been crowned by the Athenian

 People”; and the treasurer of the People

 &40& shall give to the Games-masters {athlothetais} the money

 for the crowns from the fund allocated

 to the People for expenditure on decrees; but for now it shall be

 for the receivers {apodektas} to hand over the money for the crowns

 from the military fund; and 

 &45& the secretary of the Council shall inscribe this decree

 on a stone stele and stand it near

 the one for Satyros** and Leukon**;+7+ and

 the treasurer of the People shall give thirty

 drachmas for inscribing it; and to praise the envoys,

 &50& Sosis** and Theodosios**, because they take care of those

 who visit the Bosporos @CIMMERIAN BOSPOROS@ from Athens@@; and

 invite them to hospitality in the city hall {prutaneion}

 tomorrow; and concerning the money which is

 owed to the children of Leukon**, in order that

 &55& they may recover it, the presiding committee {proedrous}

 allotted to preside in the People

 on the eighteenth+8+ shall put the matter on the agenda first after the religious business, so that

 they may recover the money and not have grounds for complaint against the

 Athenian People; and to give the ships’ officers {huperesias}

 &60& that Spartokos** and Pairisades** ask for;

 and the envoys shall give a list of the names of the

 officers whom they are going to take to the secretary

 of the Council; and it shall be the duty of those listed

 to do all in their power

 &65& for the children of Leukon**.
