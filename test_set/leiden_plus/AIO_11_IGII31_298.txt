1. because they are good men and undertake
1. for the Athenian People to look after
1. ((15)) the export of grain, as their
1. father did, and to perform enthusiastically whatever
1. service the People may require; and the envoys
1. shall report to them that if they do these things
1. there is nothing that they will fail to obtain from
1. ((20)) the Athenian People; and since they make the same grants
1. to the Athenians as Satyros and Leukon made,+5+
1. the grants which the People made
1. to Satyros and Leukon+6+ shall apply to Spartokos and Pairisades;
1. and to crown each of them with a gold crown

1. and the Games-masters < =athlothetas> shall have the crowns
1. made in the year before the Great

1. ((30)) that the Athenian People crowns
1. Spartokos and Pairisades, the children of
1. Leukon, for their excellence and good will towards the
1. Athenian People; and since they are dedicating
1. the crowns to Athena Polias,
1. ((35)) the Games-masters < =athlothetas> shall dedicate
1. the crowns in the temple, having inscribed on them: “Spartokos
1. and Pairisades, children of Leukon, dedicated
1. to Athena having been crowned by the Athenian
1. People”; and the treasurer of the People
1. ((40)) shall give to the Games-masters < =athlothetais> the money
1. for the crowns from the fund allocated
1. to the People for expenditure on decrees; but for now it shall be
1. for the receivers < =apodektas> to hand over the money for the crowns
1. from the military fund; and
1. ((45)) the secretary of the Council shall inscribe this decree
1. on a stone stele and stand it near
1. the one for Satyros and Leukon;+7+ and
1. the treasurer of the People shall give thirty
1. drachmas for inscribing it; and to praise the envoys,
1. ((50)) Sosis and Theodosios, because they take care of those
1. who visit the Bosporos @CIMMERIAN BOSPOROS@ from Athens; and
1. invite them to hospitality in the city hall < =prutaneion>
1. tomorrow; and concerning the money which is
1. owed to the children of Leukon, in order that
1. ((55)) they may recover it, the presiding committee < =proedrous>
1. allotted to preside in the People
1. on the eighteenth+8+ shall put the matter on the agenda first after the religious business, so that
1. they may recover the money and not have grounds for complaint against the
1. Athenian People; and to give the ships’ officers < =huperesias>
1. ((60)) that Spartokos and Pairisades ask for;
1. and the envoys shall give a list of the names of the
1. officers whom they are going to take to the secretary
1. of the Council; and it shall be the duty of those listed
1. to do all in their power
1. ((65)) for the children of Leukon.
